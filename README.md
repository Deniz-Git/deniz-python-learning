I'm continuing with the Angela Yu's python course. I just finished day 9. Today, hopefully, i will finish day 10.

I've installed Arch Linux btw yesterday. I chose hyprland, looks nice.It was surprisingly easy install. I was quite shocked. I was going ham with pacman, installing the usual suspects: Firefox, nvim, git, lazy-git etc. Everything was smooth!

I installed it on a USB flash drive. Wi-fi config was straight forward, touchpad worked, audio worked. Everything seemed to work out of the box.

So obviously I got a little too excited I guess. And so I decided to install spotify. It works. But resolution is pixelated. Don't know if i should try to fix it or just roll with it.

TODOS:

1. Learn how to set up nvim confidently with all the config files and basic utility solutions.
2. Continue daily with the course.
3. Take it slow with Arch. Use it as a tool, little by little build it simultaneously with your knowdledge.

See you tomorrow!

Sooooo... Things happened. 

I've bloated the bejesus out of my Arch Linux btw, by the way. And the funny thing is, it was totally unnecessary.I just wanted to, uhh.., rice waybar and wofi and why not have better lock screen... I fell into the trap again.

Well there are some positives! I know my way around better in hyprland and it's neighbouring areas. I can confidently install Arch Linux btw with hyprland now. I now know what rice is too much rice and not worth the hassle. 

Yesterday I didn't really do any meaningful python study. But I watched a video about Russell's paradox. Which was quite interesting actually. I think I was able to understand it because I learned dictionaries learning Python. Pretty cool, huh!?

Even though I'm kinda on and off with the python course these past 2 days, It is quite nice to find out that my interest is not diminishing. I've made the mistake of just burning myself plenty in previous interests. It is okay to take it slow and steady. Build other skills that will soon be necessary as I am progressing in this endeavour.

See you next time!

Yesterday I've "completed" day 11 of the Angela Yu's Python course. It was my first capstone project. 'I' have made a blackjack game. 

Things that I've struggled with:
  
  1. append() and extend()

They are same same but different. Which forced me to get my feet wet with iterators and iterables.

  2. And also game logic, I was just building the game with If statements. Luckly I quickly realized if something repeats itself I should probably create a function for it.

  3. When i first started the blackjack project, I was super excited about dictionaries. So i was putting every function in a dictionary. FOR. NO. GOOD. REASON. :'( What a waste of time...

  4. My understanding of return statements were flawed. Let's just leave it at that.

All of the aforementioned struggles just added up and burned my brain. So I decided to write the game from scratch. It went fine. 

Things that I've learned during the project:

  1. append() , extend(), remove()
  2. :%s/print/return/g or c *chef's kiss*
  3. if something looks repetitive you should probably do something about it
  4. if something looks repetitive you should probably do something about it
  5. def type():
         print("if something looks repetitive you should probably do something about it")
  6. for i in range(3):
         type()
  7. flowcharts are good, having a whiteboard makes you not only look smarter but also smarter. USE IT!

Apart from the course, I didn't really mess around with Arch btw, by the way. I've watched some more videos, read articles and surfed through the wiki. 

My Beelink Mini Me has arrived, for now just waiting for my SSDs.

Today I will do Day 12. 

See you!

I finished Day 14 on Saturday.It was challenging but somehow managed to pull it off. So it was a game called Higher Lower. You guess Ig followers of random celebrities. If you guess right score goes up and other slot gets picked randomly. 

First version of my code had a bug. So as you start a fresh run every accout that gets picked shouldn't reappear again. That part was easy. But my code was deleting global list file. So fresh runs always started with diminished lists. I took sunday off and on monday it was an easy fix. 

I've watched the lesson to see how Angela tackled the problem. 
  1. Her way of keeping a variable outside of the loop was very interesting. For some reason when i needed to do that i was putting every other thing one indent deeper instead of just taking that one small thing outside.
  2. Her checkanswer with 3 parameters was very cool. Unfortunately I'm still not very familiar with multiple parameters. It was a really good learning experience
  3. She made a function to format the string instead of repeating. Lesson learned.
  4. My favorite was putting a condition on returns. So it works like another if statement that returns bool. 

My good friend guided me through a VS code install. 
  1. Showed me how debugging works, stepping over etc. Similarly shown in the course.
    a. I was using print() for everything before, hahaha. 
  2. We installed Jupyter Notebook.
  3. Pyenv on WSL.
  4. Connecting Vs code to WSL.
  5. Choosing Python via Pyenv inside VScode

Today I will start Day 15. It is the first Intermediate lesson. 

30-09-2025:

First intermediate day was hell.

Things I struggled with:

  1.  Stop creating functions within loops, would you pleasee
  2.  Need to spend more time with dictionaries and lists. It was very difficult keeping track of stuff being reffered to dealing with multiple functions.
  3.  Make better use of functions honestly. I had the problem quite easily mapped out in my brain but couldn't translate it to code/functions properly. Run the problem via functions not the other way around.
  4. Mutable/Immutable that was interesting. So the resources was mutable and didn't need global access. But the money was immutable. Somewhat new concept for me. Need to study this more.

I will start day 16 today: Object Oriented Programming.

06-10-2025:

So python is multi-paradigm programming language. It supports both procedural programming as well as OOP.

Up until the OOP lessons I've been doing procedural programming. From my understanding it takes instructions and goes step by step. Isn't OOP also step by step. I'm a little confused on this. There is more to it that I need to study. 

Things I've learned:

  1. Inheritance
  2. Slices
  3. Reading documentation

My brain is a little fried from work and OOP. I'm content with my progression. 

07.10.2025:

Almost lost my pong_game project because I forgot to push. Thankfully I'm working on two different pcs, other one had the good files. phew...

15/10/2025:

Made more games using mainly OOB. I've been learning and playing around with CSV and pandas.
