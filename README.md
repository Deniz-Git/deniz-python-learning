I'm continuing with the Angela Yu's python course. I just finished day 9. Today, hopefully, i will finish day 10.

I've installed Arch Linux btw yesterday. I chose hyprland, looks nice.It was surprisingly easy install. I was quite shocked. I was going ham with pacman, installing the usual suspects: Firefox, nvim, git, lazy-git etc. Everything was smooth!

I installed it on a USB flash drive. Wi-fi config was straight forward, touchpad worked, audio worked. Everything seemed to work out of the box.

So obviously I got a little too excited I guess. And so I decided to install spotify. It works. But resolution is pixelated. Don't know if i should try to fix it or just roll with it.

TODOS:

1. Learn how to set up nvim confidently with all the config files and basic utility solutions.
2. Continue daily with the course.
3. Take it slow with Arch. Use it as a tool, little by little build it simultaneously with your knowdledge.

See you tomorrow!

Sooooo... Things happened. 

I've bloated the bejesus out of my Arch Linux btw, by the way. And the funny thing is, it was totally unnecessary.I just wanted to, uhh.., rice waybar and wofi and why not have better lock screen... I fell into the trap again.

Well there are some positives! I know my way around better in hyprland and it's neighbouring areas. I can confidently install Arch Linux btw with hyprland now. I now know what rice is too much rice and not worth the hassle. 

Yesterday I didn't really do any meaningful python study. But I watched a video about Russell's paradox. Which was quite interesting actually. I think I was able to understand it because I learned dictionaries learning Python. Pretty cool, huh!?

Even though I'm kinda on and off with the python course these past 2 days, It is quite nice to find out that my interest is not diminishing. I've made the mistake of just burning myself plenty in previous interests. It is okay to take it slow and steady. Build other skills that will soon be necessary as I am progressing in this endeavour.

See you next time!

Yesterday I've "completed" day 11 of the Angela Yu's Python course. It was my first capstone project. 'I' have made a blackjack game. 

Things that I've struggled with:
  
  1. append() and extend()

They are same same but different. Which forced me to get my feet wet with iterators and iterables.

  2. And also game logic, I was just building the game with If statements. Luckly I quickly realized if something repeats itself I should probably create a function for it.

  3. When i first started the blackjack project, I was super excited about dictionaries. So i was putting every function in a dictionary. FOR. NO. GOOD. REASON. :'( What a waste of time...

  4. My understanding of return statements were flawed. Let's just leave it at that.

All of the aforementioned struggles just added up and burned my brain. So I decided to write the game from scratch. It went fine. 

Things that I've learned during the project:

  1. append() , extend(), remove()
  2. :%s/print/return/g or c *chef's kiss*
  3. if something looks repetitive you should probably do something about it
  4. if something looks repetitive you should probably do something about it
  5. def type():
         print("if something looks repetitive you should probably do something about it")
  6. for i in range(3):
         type()
  7. flowcharts are good, having a whiteboard makes you not only look smarter but also smarter. USE IT!

Apart from the course, I didn't really mess around with Arch btw, by the way. I've watched some more videos, read articles and surfed through the wiki. 

My Beelink Mini Me has arrived, for now just waiting for my SSDs.

Today I will do Day 12. 

See you!
