I'm continuing with the Angela Yu's python course. I just finished day 9. Today, hopefully, i will finish day 10.


I've installed Arch Linux btw yesterday. I chose hyprland, looks nice.It was surprisingly easy install. I was quite shocked. I was going ham with pacman, installing the usual suspects: Firefox, nvim, git, lazy-git etc. Everything was smooth!

I installed it on a USB flash drive. Wi-fi config was straight forward, touchpad worked, audio worked. Everything seemed to work out of the box.

So obviously I got a little too excited I guess. And so I decided to install spotify. It works. But resolution is pixelated. Don't know if i should try to fix it or just roll with it.

TODOS:

1. Learn how to set up nvim confidently with all the config files and basic utility solutions.
2. Continue daily with the course.
3. Take it slow with Arch. Use it as a tool, little by little build it simultaneously with your knowdledge.

See you tomorrow!
